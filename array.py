#ARRAYS

"""
-> Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements in a continous block of memory.
-> Each element in an array , is identified by an index, starting from 0.
-> Arrays provide constant time access to any elemtn using its index

LEY CHARACTERISTICS
->  Arrays can have a fixed size or be dynamic
-> In strict arrays, all elements must be of the same type, in  pythons lists, they can store elements of different types (integers, strings, objects) i.e Heterogenous
-> Elements are accessed using their index
-> Elements are stored next to each other in memory (Contigous Memory), allowing fast access but potentially costly when resizing
-> Lists can grow or shrink as needed by using methods like append() or pop()
-> Lists can have references to objects, not raw data, so they use more memory than traditional arrays
